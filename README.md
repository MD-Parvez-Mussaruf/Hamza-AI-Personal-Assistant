Hamza: AI Personal Assistant



API Key Security: For security reasons, never hard-code your API key directly in your code. Instead, consider using environment variables.
Exception Handling: Enhance exception handling for robustness.
Comments and Documentation: Ensure the comments are clear and helpful.

Key Changes:
API Key Security: Use environment variables to store sensitive information like the API key.
Enhanced Exception Handling: Added exception handling for various potential errors.
Robust Music Directory Handling: Added checks and exception handling for playing music.
Improved Comments and Documentation: Clarified comments to make the code more understandable.
Setting Up Environment Variable:
To set the environment variable for your OpenAI API key, you can follow these steps:

On Windows:
set OPENAI_API_KEY=your-api-key


Make sure to replace your-api-key with your actual OpenAI API key.

Running the Assistant:
Install Required Libraries: pip install pyttsx3 SpeechRecognition wikipedia requests

Run the Script: python my_voice_assistant.py

Interacting with the Assistant:
You can now interact with the assistant by speaking commands and questions. The assistant will handle predefined commands directly and forward other queries to ChatGPT for a response.
